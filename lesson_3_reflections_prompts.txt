When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    all time. They should be synchronized

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    you know/assess when it needs to be done(finished part of the code). You are sure that internet connection is alive
