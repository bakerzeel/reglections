How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    highliting the place where mistake is only

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    wasting less time on bugs finding or versions comparing

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    mannualy >> you can choose a moment when to save but sometimes you just forget to do this
    automatically >> always 'saved' but sometimes you don't need some changes to be saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    project managment system is different

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log >> i don't know
    diff file1 file2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can find the issue quicker

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    project design

    better logicaly structured commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    git log >> to see all changes has been done in the repository;

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    you can always go back and find when bug has been introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    
    create a repository for whatever stuff (recipes, programming etc)
